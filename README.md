In a sea of online courses, learners often feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume

to individual needs. Rewarding skill badges to enhance motivation and recognition 
and avatar upgradations.
Additionally, we are introducing a feature of interactive learning with music,

theory, we provide specialized playlists designed to boost concentration levels. 
These curated music playlists will adapt to the learning context, enhancing the 
overall educational experience and ensuring learners stay focused and motivated.
